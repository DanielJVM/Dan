# Dan's README file for Profile
## Hello There
This is supposed "the" profile README, (I already mentioned this, but I shall keep it) as I follow along GitHub's "Start your journey" guide.  
#### Interesting use of hashtags... heading control, so four as well, up until what size? Heading 7?

So... Type about myself? Because it's a readme file for profile... Ok...  
I like arts.  
Oooohh "Markdown Cheat Sheet"...  

I like arts, **visual arts** to be specific...  
Maybe that's not specific enough... Also misleading... *Animation* is one. There's *film*, so, *Cinematography*, and then of course, *Photography*!  
Yeah... I really like them...  

So... how come I'm here? `coding`...  

It is also quite neat. Game Developing is also interesting...  
Though... I really enjoy **narratives**, thinking and making them too, *i m a g i n a t i o n*  
Maybe even asset creation, from 2d pixel sprites, to 3d high-poly models...

Oh well, I'm here now. I've used `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`, by the time of typing this that is.  
If given the chance, I'd like to try Unity... We've studied `C++` before, so... `C#`... Maybe I can learn it...
